        <p class="content">We use the OR-ORco system to detect the 4Va concentration in the collected air. This method detects the signal by specifically binding and opening ion channels with 4Va that penetrates into the solution and the insect’s olfactory receptors, resulting in a voltage difference.
        The detection device uses a gas flow system to input signal molecules. When the signal molecules are exchanged into the solution, they bind to the receptors on the device to generate signals. We believe that the binding reaction between the signal molecule and the receptor is irreversible and directly related to the concentration of the signal molecule in the solution. The relationship can be quantified by the standard curve method. Therefore, considering the change of the signal molecule exchanged by the gas flow system is the point of the model.</p>

        <p class="content">Signal molecules are exchanged into the solution through holes when the gas flows, and only 4Va molecules are considered in this model. Therefore, a single-factor permeation model can be considered. We consider using the Noyes-Whitney equation to describe the permeation process, where the parameters of the diffusion layer are determined by the device, and the exchange concentration of gas molecules is mainly affected by the gas flow velocity and the concentration in the air influences.</p>

        <p class="content">Figure 2 illustrates that the signal intensity gradually reaches its maximum value with the gas exchange and then decreases. 500X, 1000X represent the concentration in the pipe relative to the solution. The higher the gas concentration, the greater the signal strength.</p>
        <p class="content">We observe the influence of gas flow time on signal intensity at the same time in a continuous concentration gradient range, and get the heat map in Figure 3. Figure 3 reflects the distribution of signal intensity in a continuous concentration range, and the standard curve can be obtained from the heat map distribution at a certain point in time. It is worth noting that the increase in signal intensity within a certain period of time after the concentration changes from 500 X to 1000 X is not obvious. According to this heat map, we can artificially adjust the gas flow speed of the device to amplify the signal difference.</p>

            <p class="content">Our regulatory part called CarH protein is controlled by green light. In the condition of light, CarH tetramers repress the expression of dsRNA. When we use only green light, the tetramers dissociate, thus activating the expression of dsRNA. However, without the light, there is not any product,dsRNA, in the system we designed in Saccharomvces cerevisiae. Saccharomvces cerevisiae enters the rapid growth phase. The mechanics are described in Figure 1.</p>

            <p class="content">CarH tetramer is a dimer of dimers. The tetramer is a repressor of the CarH promoter with ≈ 5th order cooperativity, whereas the individual monomers and dimers do not bind significantly. For simplicity, we consider that the tetramer accords with the Hill function of mRNA transcription. We think that CarH tetramer consists of four CarH monomer with VB12 through random collision. A photon of light is absorbed by cobalamin in the CarH light-sensing domain and changes its conformation. This reaction of disassociating the tetramer is light activating and irreversible, with the subsequently light-state inert CarH domains forming.</p>

        <p class="content">Figure 2 illustrates the rapid conversion of CarH tetramer into CarH monomer after turning on green light. The RNA in the conditions is provided in a limited amount, which is to simulate the limitation of the number of engineering bacteria. With the consumption of CarH RNA, the amount of CarH monomer is slowly degraded. In summary, the light control effect is good.</p>
        <p class="content">Figure 3 is our further idea of the light control effect. In a certain period of time, we hope to increase the light intensity to control the engineered bacteria to express more target proteins. We used 3μ, 4μ, and 5μ light intensity respectively. It can be seen from the results that the light intensity does not affect the production rate of the terminal product, but it is possible to synthesize more target products in a longer time through a limited number of engineered bacterial populations.</p>

            <p class="content">The designed circuit in cell A is under control of a temperature sensitive cI repressor. Upon raising the temperature, cI will dissociate from the promoter and the circuit is activated. This leads to the initiation of the production of LuxR and LuxI. LuxI will consecutively produce AHL, which binds with LuxR. The newly formed complex will then activate the production of leucine and Ag43. Leucine and AHL are also able to diffuse out of the cell into the medium. Ag43 is the adhesine which aids the aggregation of cells A, while leucine and AHL are necessary to repel cells B.</p>
            <p class="content">Generally speaking, this is a quorum sensing control switch activated by light induction. LuxI and LuxR are the molecules used in quorum sensing. Much protein transcription and translation are involved in the induction system.</p>

            <p class="content">For cell A we made a simulation with cell A in the ON and OFF mode as visuable in figure 2. When cell A is in the OFF state, the whole designed circuit is in OFF mode. This means that the cI repressor is succesful in repressing the design. If the degradation rate of cI is raised to simulate the temperature rising, we see that all the components of the system show a big increase. For LuxR this increase is only temporary, but this is also explainable. Since LuxI keeps on producing AHL which binds LuxR to form a complex. Indeed all the LuxR reacts to form the complex.</p>
